                    The Water Fountains in Sigiriya are very famous all around the world. To bring more beauty
                    to the water garden King Kashyapa built 4 water fountains in the garden. These are still 
                    active even after 1500 years. To produce water pressure an underline pipe system is used
                    and so the builders built this system from highland to low. Then water flows in a great
                    speed using earth's gravity.
